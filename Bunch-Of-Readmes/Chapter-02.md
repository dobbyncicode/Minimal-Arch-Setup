## Chapter 02: Installing needed softwares

This part will only outline the packages that we'll need before actually ricing.

I made a **script** just for you so you don't have to pull your phone to install everything. Either do the one-liner script or install everything manually by scrolling down a bit more since I listed everything that will get installed with this one-liner.
```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://tinyurl.com/Installer-Sh)
